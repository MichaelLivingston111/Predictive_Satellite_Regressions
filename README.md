# Predictive_regressions-_satellite_data
A project that utilizes satellite data from NASA and predictive regressions on a global scale.

Here, there is code files from both python and R detailing algorithms for linear mixed effects models. The python algorithm will be used in to predict values from the satellites, but the R algorithm can be visualized and validated better.
