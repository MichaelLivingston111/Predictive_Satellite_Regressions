# Predictive_Satellite_Regressions


Marine exopolymers, or 'gels' are an important element in global carbon cycle as they are critical for the sequestraion of carbon dioxide in the ocean. Furthermore, they are an important substance in the desalination industry as they frequently clog reverse osmosis filters critical for efficient desalination. As such, it is important to develop models that may estimate marine expolymer concetrations from both satellite and remote sensor derived data.

This project creates a series of predictive models to estimate the concentrations of exopolymers at the oceans surface from a suite of commomly reported variables on both remote sensors and satellites. 

The "model selection" file creates and validates a series of models. Three more files specify the exact details for each independent model, named "Satellite_sensor_model", "Remote_sensor model", and "Feature_model" with details therein. The "model prediction" file derives the actual predictions from data files, while the "model visualization" file visualizes the resutls from a few select periods.
